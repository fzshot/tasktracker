For this homework, the design almost exactly the same as in HW6.
When creator of a task edit the task, he/she can edit all fields in ths task,
but for users of a task, he/she can only edit the time spent and completeness of the task.
When user loged in to the site, they can only see the task that they created ot been assigned to them.
The difference in the homework is there is no administrator user for this implementation.
